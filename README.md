```python
from neo_api_client import NeoAPI


# Either you pass consumer_key and consumer_secret or you pass acsess_token 
# access_token: It is optional. If you have barrier token then pass and consumer_key and consumer_secret will be optional.
# environment: By default it's uat. You can pass prod to connect to live server
# neo_fin_key: Key you recieve at the time of api registration on your registered email id
# base_url: You'll get by calling base_url api
client = NeoAPI(environment='prod', access_token=None, neo_fin_key=None)


# Login using TOTP

# Complete your TOTP registration from Kotak Securities website. Follow steps mentioned below.

# Visit https://www.kotaksecurities.com/platform/kotak-neo-trade-api/ and select Register for Totp.
# Totp registration is a one time step where you can register for totp on your mobile and start receiving totps.

# Step 1 - Verify your mobile no with OTP

# Step 2 - Select account, for which you want to register for totp

# Step 3 - Select option to register for totp

# Step 4 - You will receive a QR code, which is valid for 5 minutes

# Step 5 - Open any authenticator app, and scan the QR code

# Step 6 - You will start receiving the Totps on the authenticator apps

# Step 7 - Submit the totp on the QR code page to complete the Totp registration

# mobile_number: registered mobile number with the country code.
# ucc: Unique Client Code which you will find in mobile application/website under profile section
# totp: Time-based One-Time Password recieved on google authenticator application
# totp_login generates the view token and session id used to generate trade token
client.totp_login(mobile_number="", ucc="", totp='')

# mpin: mpin for your neo account
# totp_validate generates the trade token
client.totp_validate(mpin="")


# Alternate Login Method - Login using QR code (User can either login with TOTP or with QR flow)

# ucc: Unique Client Code which you will find in mobile application/website under profile section
# qr_code_get_link returns a qrcode
client.qr_code_get_link(ucc='')

# ott: You will recieve ott by scanning qr code through kotak's application 
# ucc: Unique Client Code which you will find in mobile application/website under profile section
# trade token is generated on passing ott to qr_code_generate_session 
client.qr_code_generate_session(ott='', ucc='')


# Once you have session token after completing 2FA, you can place the order by using below function
# exchange_segment: Expected values are nse_cm, bse_cm, nse_fo, bse_fo, cde_fo. 
# For exchange_segment nse_cm expected product=NRML, CNC, MIS, CO, BO. Add order_type=L, MKT, SL, SL-M. 
# For exchange_segment bse_cm expected product=NRML, CNC, MIS, CO, BO. Add order_type=L, MKT, SL, SL-M.
# For exchange_segment nse_fo expected product=NRML, MIS, BO. Add order_type=L, MKT, SL, SL-M.
# For exchange_segment bse_fo expected product=NRML, MIS. Add order_type=L, MKT, SL, SL-M.

# For exchange_segment cde_fo expected product=NRML, MIS. Add order_type=L, MKT, SL, SL-M.

# product: Expected values are NRML, CNC, MIS, CO, BO
# price: scrip price
# order_type: Expected values are L, MKT, SL, SL-M
# quantity: The stock quantity(If suppose one lot size of a stock is 25, then in disclosed_quantity you have to pass 25 and not 1)
# validity: Expected values are DAY, IOC, GTC, EOS, GTD
# trading_symbol: scrip trading symbol. You will get this value from master scrip file
# transaction_type: Expected values are B, S
# amo: Expected values are either YES or NO
# disclosed_quantity: by default 0. Disclosed quantity (DQ) is a feature that allows traders to only disclose a portion of their order quantity to the market. This feature is useful when trading large quantities of shares. For example, if your quantity is 10, then disclosed_quantity can be between 0 to 10 (only disclosed _quantity will be visible in market depth)
# market_protection: by default 0. Market protection, also known as Market Price Protection (MPP), is a feature that protects investors from sudden price movements in the stock market. For example, if the Last Traded Price (LTP) is ₹100 and a 5% Market Protection is applied, your order will be placed as a limit order at ₹105. This means your buy order will only be executed if sellers are available at ₹105 or below. If no sellers are available within this range, your order will remain open as a limit order.
# pf: by default N
# trigger_price: Price on which ypur order will be open to the market
# tag: Give your own tag to track the order
# scrip_token: Applicable only for Bracket Order
# square_off_type: Applicable only for Bracket Order. Expected Values are 'Absolute' and 'Ticks'.
# stop_loss_type: Applicable only for bracket Order. Expected Values are 'Absolute' and 'Ticks'.
# stop_loss_value: Applicable only for Bracket Order
# square_off_value: Applicable only for Bracket Order
# last_traded_price: Applicable only for Bracket Order
# trailing_stop_loss: Applicable only for Bracket Order. Expected Values are 'Y' and 'N'.
# trailing_sl_value: Applicable only for Bracket Order. Expected Values are 'Y' and 'N'.
